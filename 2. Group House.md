Dave: Made it out west to San Francisco
Asked my friends where in the city to go

Quinn: A Victorian house on Steiner and Oak
36 founders, most of them bros

Dave: Applied online and they said I could pay
For a spot with no window on the floor for $2k
I show up at the door ask hey where’s my room

House Resident 1: We can kick out the guy who’s currently in it soon
But get an air pump cause the mattress is depleting 

House Manager: Hey you’re just in time for the house meeting! So, regarding the house budget: 20% of funds will go to to trips and drugs, and trips with drugs Any questions on the budget?

House Resident 1: Listen I’ve been thinking the sink is full and garbage is stinkin’, and whoever was drinkin’ we should start a poll, to decide which of you is cleaning the toilet bowl

House Manager: That's how it works in a group house

House Resident 2: Hey, I think I just saw a mouse?

House Manager: That’s how it works in a group house

House Resident 3: Eric’s not paying any rent and he’s spent the last 6 months on our couch 

All: That’s how it works in a group house (4x)

House Resident 2:
I would like to voice a serious complaint
Someone f*cked my girlfriend
How is that okay? 

House Manager: If she’s poly uh, then it’s fair game
Calm down for one second let me explain
It’s not exclusive unless you define it that way

House Resident 2: She said I could be her primary partner someday

House Manager: That means you’re in a polycule with Akshay
You're her secondary partner for side play

All: That’s how it works in a group house (4x)

House Manager: Now the whole third floor is off doing whippets - 25 years old and he can't do the dishes!

House Resident 1: Uh why do the dishes when you can just throw them out 

House Manager: Well, that’s how it works in a group house.

[Dish shatters]

House Resident 1: We can just buy new ones on Amazon right?
