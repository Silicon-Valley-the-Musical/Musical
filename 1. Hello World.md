Gordon Greene: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Demo Day! We have a room full of investors looking to fund the next big startup. First up, RobotMe!

Quinn Morris: Hello! My name is Quinn!

Dave DuCharme: And I’m Dave.

Quinn: Today we’re announcing RobotMe! A personal robot for your home needs.
No more folding clothes or clearing weeds
We just need an investor to lead our seed.

Gordon: Well, you’re in the right place if it’s money you need
I’m Gordon Greene, and I’m the best VC
I’ll hear you out if your from Stanford or MIT
But make it quick, I’m hitting Tahoe to ski.
 
Quinn: I cleaned the house for my family growing up
Without my parents around, it was really tough
Cleaning 2 hours a day that’s a lot of time
And there’s 100 million houses just like mine 
We’re saving so many lives
And by bridging the household labor divide
Feminism is solved! isn’t that great,

Dave: Hey my name’s Dave,
I lived in a frat and a giant estate
Managed workers and maids by the age of 8. 
My dad wants me to take over the day to day
But I know I’m meant for something great. 
So when I first met Quinn at MIT
And I saw that prototype in MechE
I knew my life’s purpose was RobotMe 

Gordon: Well that will never work so I’m gonna pass
That toaster on wheels belongs in the trash
Here’s some advice, you kids should get back to class
Give me a call when you pivot to B2B SaaS


Quinn: When you see all our traction
You’ll regret your inaction
Gotta take a leap of faith
To make something great

I know it’s money you crave
You can’t take that to the grave
We have the world to save
So many lives to change 

Gordon: They’re changing the world and I won’t miss out
Quinn: Got so much to prove to those who cast doubt
Dave: And I’ll find my own way and make father proud

All: And together we can change the world
And together we can change the world

Gordon: No investor will ever take you seriously. Next.
