Gordon: I, I just missed out on the round
And it’s the hottest, new startup in town
How could they say no to me
I’m just a good guy VC
Now I missed out
I took them out for a steak
I never asked once if I thought their metrics were fake
But when I tried to invest
They said there’s too much int-rest
Now I missed out
I thought I did everything right
Like give the founder so much really good advice
When all my LPs find out
They’ll say I let them all down
Since I missed out
I used to be so well renowned 
How will I ever afford my third vacation house
Do you feel sorry for me
Now that I’ll make less money
It’s not easy
To be a VC
