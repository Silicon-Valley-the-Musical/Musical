Cotton: Thanks for coming out tonight to the debut performance of Silicon Valley: The Musical. 

About a year ago, Kyle, Belinda, and Scott were living in a group house in San Francisco. They started having casual jam sessions:

Scott would produce a beat
Belinda would sing a melody over it
And Kyle would lay down freestyle raps

The songs they wrote sparked the idea for Silicon Valley: The Musical.

This is a preview - a rough draft - of what they aim to bring to life as a full fledged musical on stage in July at the Marine’s Memorial Theatre in San Francisco.

[….pause….]

Today, we follow the story of two young startup founders, Quinn and Dave, on their quest to change the world.

They face off against Silicon Valley stereotypes, the existential risk of AI killing us all, and countless rejections, including one from the famed venture capitalist, Gordon Greene, who is set on crushing their dreams. 

We hope you enjoy the show.

Narrator Kyle: Quinn and Dave's company, RobotMe, is off to a rough start after a brutal rejection at Demo Day, but fear not, they have a clear vision of how to best position themselves to fundraise: they'll pay 3 times average rent to live in an SF hacker house shared with 30 other founders and researchers. 

With 30 ambitious, 20-something adults all living under a single roof; what could possibly go wrong?

Narrator Kyle: Despite the chaos of their living situation and the many naysayers, Quinn and Dave at RobotMe post a demo tweet of their product that goes viral. 

Anyone can make a graph going up and to the right - but what you can't make up is Elon Musk retweeting RobotMe, even if the caption was "Optimus needs a little brother to make him toast."

This was the kind of social proof investors needed to be certain RobotMe was destined to be a unicorn. RobotMe proceeds to close one of the hottest rounds of their batch, led by none other than the legendary venture capital firm a15d.

Narrator Kyle: Not everyone is celebrating RobotMe's raise, however. Gordon Greene is feeling major FOMO after seeing his arch nemesis at a15d lead the round. 

Belinda and Kyle exit.

[<Missed Out/>](4.%20Missed%20Out.md)

Belinda and Kyle enter.

Narrator Kyle: I'm glad we've given Gordon the space to talk about the struggles he has as a VC. You know, as part of The 1% he's in an underrepresented community, since there's just… so few of them.

Meanwhile, elsewhere in SF an AI doomer philosopher can't stand to see Elon shamelessly retweeting RobotMe - ChatGPT was dangerous enough, imagine when you give it a steak knife!

Kyle and Scott change into Elon and Eliezer outfits.

Narrator Belinda: Alright! This next one is here for the AI crowd. Put your hand if you identify as EA? Alright, how about e/acc? Well this is awkward, sorry for putting you in the same room. Anyways this next song is meant to pit you against each other. Hope you enjoy.

Scott changes into VC outfit.

Narrator Kyle: The rap battle accelerates RobotMe customer adoption, but not everyone is excited about that.

You see, Gordon missed out on their round. And when you're a VC, there's really nothing worse that can happen to you. 

Every time Gordon opens Twitter, he sees more pictures of Elon retweeting that stupid toaster.

We'll see who's really toast. 

Belinda and Kyle exit.

Scott exits, Kyle enters.

Narrator Kyle: Competitors abound, the co-founders are having it rough and not just from the startup angle.

They are realizing doing a startup isn't just all about flashy launches & fundraises, sometimes its waking up at 7am, impulse opening your phone and seeing the top headline is your competitor raising a massive round to build your exact thing. 

Sure, you traded off school, a stable income, and time with your family to embody the ethos of a good founder, but when things suck it makes you start asking what really keeps you going. 

Quinn and Dave take some time apart to process the news. Quinn leaves the home and takes a walk through her favorite park… this is what's on her mind.

Belinda enters alone. 

[<Attention is All You Need />](5.%20Attention%20Is%20All%20You%20Need.md)

Scott enters alone.

Narrator Scott: Quinn introspects through reading her favorite research papers. Meanwhile, Dave is processing the news by finally responding to all those Hinge matches he ghosted to work on his startup. To his surprise, they don't respond, so he resorts to taking up some new hobbies like climbing, biking, and hiking. 

Kyle enters alone. Scott enters for last chorus.

[<Not Just a Tech Bro />](6.%20Not%20Just%20a%20Tech%20Bro.md)

Narrator Kyle: Silicon Valley is a place where everyone wants to be the main character. But this means in hard times it can feel like you don't have a supporting cast. Quinn's friends are either making it big and settling down, or packing up and leaving San Francisco altogether. Did they see the true cost of pursuing a dream? 

The city demands a steep price. It is a place that founders and techies can afford, but that most people can't. As she wanders through the streets, she comes to see that there are many sides to a dream, what one person considers failures might be what another would give anything for.

For her, San Francisco is more than just a quick pit stop on the career ladder –  there's vibrancy, the redwoods, beauty at every turn. Still, she sees so many friends whither away in its wind, moving up a few rungs, but leaving the city neglected like an unwatered plant.

Quinn looks out at the streets and wonders what in the world they should really be trying to change….


Belinda enters alone.

Narrator Scott: Annnddd that's a wrap! This is the end of the preview of SV: the Musical.

We are looking to bring this performance to life for a limited run in July at Marine's Memorial Theatre. If you want to see it happen, please follow the project on Instgram and tell your friends. If you know anyone we should talk to as we flesh this out into a full fledged musical, let us know.

Some of the music will be on Spotify shortly and we’ll send out a link in the Partiful.

We have this space for the next half an hour, so please mingle and chat! We'll be around and here to talk more about SV the Musical. 

Thanks to Cotton for helping with stage direction, and to Manny’s staff. Please buy things from Manny’s and tip generously.
