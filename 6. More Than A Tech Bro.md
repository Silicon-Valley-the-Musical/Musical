Girl: I went on a date with this guy, and he was such a tech bro.

Dave: To code, or not to code, that is the query:
Final swig of my Soylent my eyes are weary 
A cold shower should wake me as my podcast said
But it feels warm I leave damp and dim my sunset lamp to rest my head  
There’s no bed frame I’m so frugal
Shall i grind algorithms to make a fortune at google
or browse reddit and 4chan 
I refresh my feed 
10 likes in 5 min it’s banging meme.
But why… Why do my matches not see beyond the screen? Am I not the full package, or so it would seem?

I am more than a tech bro
I have hobbies like climbing and hiking 
I am more than a tech bro
If I work weekends it’s just cause I like it

Listen, allow me to explain
Us guys in tech, we’re not all the same
I cold plunge, I know pain
I watch anime and play japanese games

I believe in equality from the first date
That’s why I told her she could pay
Why’d she complain 

Ugh Whatever 

I multithread like a machine
in C i'm keen i bang out lines in vim on dripped out triple screens
i don’t code with default keys 
mechanical keyboard only please
modded linux with i3 
a gpu and ssd 


I’m not a tech bro I meditate 
on 2x speed 
I got Lex and Joe and Principles by Dalio in my feed

I grew up watchin Bill & Steve
but look at that i guess the apples falling closer to the tree 

Male Cast:
I am more than a tech bro
I have hobbies like climbing and hiking 
I am more than a tech bro
If I work weekends it’s just cause I like it
