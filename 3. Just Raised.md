Dave: Just raised 2 million for the company
Now things are starting to look up for me

I got money in the bank - 7 figures
So it figures I’m starting to think bigger

I’m cashing checks, got Ramp and Brex
A girl from the hackathon replied to my text

Whatchya gonna do with all that money?
Why I always gotta explain
It’s not mine it’s the company’s

Step 1: Imma get a new office lease
Step 2: Imma pull up with the Tesla keys
Ask my boss for a raise, oh wait, that’s me
company socks and company Tees
Yes please

All: Just raised a round 
Raise the roof 
Money in the bank 
And something to prove 
x2

Quinn:
Launched 3 months ago, our app is looking fine
But month over month growth is a flat line
Bank account shows 6 months of runway
Lost our biggest customer on Monday 

My friends are making 600k at Google
Meanwhile we’re making nothing but Ramen noodles
 
We’re iterating and the VCs are forever hating
competitors waiting if we slip up They’re celebrating

All: Falling behind, falling behind
There’s so much on my mind 
And never enough time
Falling behind, Falling behind
All my friends are thriving 
and I’m getting tired

Dave: 2 years grinding, and I’m not sure how much longer
Everyone else is getting faster and stronger
There’s always someone better and bolder
In San Francisco there’s no attitude colder

If your startup ain’t valued at a billy
If you’re not on some list of someone under 30
To get ahead they say you gotta play dirty
That’s why I’m on my keyboard slapping dat QWERTY

All: Falling behind, falling behind
There’s so much on my mind 
And never enough time
Falling behind, Falling behind
All my friends are thriving 
and I’m getting tired
