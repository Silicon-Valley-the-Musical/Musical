Quinn: Attention is all you need
but don’t come crawling back here
To get it from me 

Validation, oh that’s what you seek
Your lies can’t generalize 
And you overfit to me 

Can feel some hesitation
How you train me then test me 
Oh you never had the patience

I need one shot
To make you want me

Before you leave with someone new
Is she state of the art

I feel in tune with you
That’s the state of my heart

You finish sentences I say
As soon as I start

No one knows me better
Oh letter for letter

But you talk in generalities
Hallucinate reality

Attention is all you need
but don’t come crawling back here
To get it from me 

Validation, oh that’s what you seek
Your lies can’t generalize 
And you overfit to me
