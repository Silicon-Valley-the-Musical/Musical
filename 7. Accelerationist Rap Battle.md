Announcer: Live, from San Francisco - a  rap battle to decide whether AI will bring us utopia or extinction. Defending AI is tech titan Elon Musk. And advocating its regulation….Eliezer Yudkowsky.

Announcer: First up,Elon!

Elon: 
In Silicon Valley there are two factions
Those who do nothing and those who bias to action
So Eliezer it’s time we had a talk
Your fear of AI and hesitation needs to stop 

Climate change, poverty, scarcity, war
AI can solve all these problems and more
When it comes to space travel I’m a founding father
You’re famous for fanfic of harry potter

Elizier
Hm, Well, It’s statistically likely if we look at the math
there’s a 70% chance i can kick your ass
the bayesian probabilities don’t rationalize that  
You’re actually just an asshole under the guise

Of caring about climate, poverty, and war
You could start by paying workers more
And speaking of slave wages
Are you in the middle ages?

10 kids with 5 women of so many different ages
Fucking up companies at so many stages
Getting served lawsuits so many pages
Did you predict this as part of your manic rages? 

Elon: You call it divorce i call her my Space X
With my new girl having crazy Space sex 
I’m king of electric cars, mars, the stars too
The Incel subreddit, that’s all you

and it’s hard to take seriously anything you’ve said
since i bought Twitter and see all the girls who left you on read 

Elizier You read my texts, talk about sadistic
You’re a fixated capitalist, I’m effectively altruistic
You preach first principles - do you know who wrote ‘em?
Your SpaceX employees read the blog where I show em

Elon: Eliezier, you’re the most boring company
Crying about AI killing us at every opportunity
I know you want attention but man this is low
But there’s one last thing before I go
remember I founded OpenAI
That means our new overlords are on my side

Eliezer: I prepared the world for the risk of AGI
When the real threat all along
Is a single guy

Elon: I’m not single just ask your mom
