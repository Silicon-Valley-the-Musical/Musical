Gordon: I I missed out on the round
And I won’t stand to get laughed out town
I hope some competition won’t get you down
Cause I found better startup and I led their round 

I gave them 5, $5 million dollars
Stanford and MIT, the team’s got some scholars

While you’re living on Soylent and Ramen Noodles
They just hired another executive straight outta Google! 

I - I missed out on the round
And I won’t look like the fool in this town
If you don’t know their name by now here’s a warning
You’ll see them on Tech Crunch tomorrow morning
