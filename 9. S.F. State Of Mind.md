Quinn: Oh the hills of San Francisco
Fog is rolling so deep
on an incline too steep
In a rush some fall behind
All have money on their minds
Below they hide in wait
They bide their time to prey

Oh the hills of San Francisco
Fog is rolling so deep
on an incline so steep
Green fields are on the mind
Gold seekers magnetized
For some, they’ll never wait
They work hard and pray

The ephemeral weather is giving me shivers
mile by mile, hour by hour
Infinite reminders
Of the world, she plays
People sleep on streets outside
Victorians in silk sheets
Everybody’s working begging
using, playing, needing
it’s so fleeting

Oh the hills of San Francisco
Fog is rolling so deep
on an incline too steep
In the rush some fall behind
All have money on their minds
Some, they hide in wait
To bide their time and pray

The schizophrenic weather makes me feel untethered
block to block, day to day
from the mission to east bay
there’s a chasm at play
People sleep on streets outside
Victorians in silk sheets
Everybody’s working begging
using, playing, needing
it’s so fleeting

Oh the hills of San Francisco
Fog is rolling so deep
on an incline too steep
In a rush some fall behind
All have money on their minds
We look out to the bay
We had everything but time

It’s so fleeting, so fleeting….

Because that’s what happens 
Under a torn open sky
In a city borrowed from the sea.
